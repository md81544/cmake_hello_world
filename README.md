## A Quick CMake Starter Framework

`brew install catch2`

For use in VSCode. To select debug or release run "CMake: Select Configure Preset"

If tests don't show up in the test explorer, ensure that `"cmake.ctest.testExplorerIntegrationEnabled": true` is set

Might want to put tests in a separate subdirectory.

Note how code shared with tests is placed in a static library.
